# Music-Recommendation-System Music reccomendation system usig Cosine similarty
The Music Recommendation System is an application that leverages machine learning techniques and the Spotify API to recommend songs based on user preferences. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input songs they like, and the system generates recommendations of similar songs.

**Features**
Song Recommendation: Recommends similar songs based on user-selected songs or artists.
Album Cover Display: Retrieves album covers and song details using the Spotify API for visual representation.
Interactive Interface: Allows users to interactively select songs and view recommendations with album artwork.

**Cosine Similarity for Song Lyrics**
One of the key features of the Music Recommendation System is its use of cosine similarity to recommend songs based on song lyrics. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. **In the context of this system:**
**Vectors: **Represent song lyrics as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
**Similarity Calculation:** Computes similarity between songs based on the angle between their lyric vectors.
**Enhanced Recommendation:** Provides more accurate recommendations by considering lyrical content similarity in addition to musical style and artist preferences.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language used for backend development and machine learning.
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications.
Spotipy: Python library for Spotify API integration.
Machine Learning: Techniques such as cosine similarity for recommendation algorithm.
